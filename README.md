I built a full-stack web application that simulates an e-commerce bookstore experience. With this app, users can:
âœ… Browse a collection of books
âœ… View detailed descriptions
âœ… Add books to a shopping cart
âœ… Complete a mock checkout process

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack Highlights:

Frontend: [React/Next.js/Other framework you used]

Backend: [Node.js/Express/Django/etc.]

Database: [MongoDB/MySQL/PostgreSQL/etc.]

Styling: [Tailwind CSS/Bootstrap/etc.]

This project was a great way to dive deeper into full-stack development, implementing state management, routing, authentication, and CRUD operations while also practicing clean UI/UX design.

ðŸ’¡ The Online Bookstore is a simple demonstration of how modern web technologies can bring basic e-commerce functionality to life.

Always open to feedback, suggestions, or collaborations! ðŸ™Œ
